### Installation

Requires PHP 5.5 or later. There are no plans to support PHP 5.4 or PHP 5.3. In case this is an obstacle for you,
conversion should be no problem. The library is very small.

It is installable and autoloadable via Composer as [genkgo/camt](https://packagist.org/packages/genkgo/camt).

To run the unit tests at the command line, issue `phpunit -c tests/`. [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/) is required.

This library attempts to comply with [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][], and [PSR-4][]. If
you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.

[PSR-1]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md
[PSR-2]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md
[PSR-4]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md

[PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) is used to ensure PSR coding standards are respected.

To fix CS, just launch

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

A `.php_cs` file in the root directory excludes `vendor` directory from fixing and contains coding standards level wanted (PSR-2).

## Getting Started

Read a CAMT file, and loop through its statements and entries.

```php
<?php
use Genkgo\Camt\Config;
use Genkgo\Camt\Reader;

$reader = new Reader(Config::getDefault());
$message = $reader->readFile(__DIR__.'/Camt053/Stubs/camt053.v2.minimal.xml');
$statements = $message->getRecords();
foreach ($statements as $statement) {
  $entries = $statement->getEntries();
}
```
