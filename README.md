## Getting Started

Read a CAMT file, and loop through its statements and entries.

```php
<?php
use Genkgo\Camt\Config;
use Genkgo\Camt\Reader;

$reader = new Reader(Config::getDefault()));
$message = $reader->readFile(__DIR__.'/Camt053/Stubs/camt053.minimal.xml');
$statements = $message->getStatements();
foreach ($statements as $statement) {
  $entries = $statement->getEntries();
}
```
